          <h3 className="mt-6 text-xl font-semibold text-foreground">Media</h3>
          <p>

          <h3 className="mt-6 text-xl font-semibold text-foreground">Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.
          </p>

          <h3 className="mt-6 text-xl font-semibold text-foreground">Embedded content from other websites</h3>
          <p>
            Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
          </p>
          <p>
            These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mt-8 text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground">4. Who we share your data with</h2>
          <p>
            If you request a password reset, your IP address will be included in the reset email. We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide users with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mt-8 text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground">5. How long we retain your data</h2>
          <p>
            If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
          </p>
          <p>
            For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mt-8 text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground">6. What rights you have over your data</h2>
          <p>
            Under the UK GDPR, you have various rights in relation to your personal data. These include the right to:

          </ul>
          <p>
            If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
          </p>
          
          <h2 className="mt-8 text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground">7. Where your data is sent</h2>
          <p>
            Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service. Your data may be transferred to and stored at a destination outside the UK. Where we transfer your data outside the UK, we will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your data in accordance with UK data protection laws.
